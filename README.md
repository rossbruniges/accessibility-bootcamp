Accessibility Bootcamp
=======================

My working notes and ideas for an accessibility bootcamp to be enjoyed (hopefully)
by a new intake of graduate developers at Marks and Spencer (Digital).

Things to remember:
* knowledge of HTML and other front-end technology unknown
* slides may not be totally relevant
* we want people excited about accessibility after the session has been run, not
nessessarily knowing all the answers but with the desire to go and work on finding
them with their teams

Things would like help with:
* accessibility resources
* thoughts on existing content
  * have I missed anything clear?
* spelling and grammer
