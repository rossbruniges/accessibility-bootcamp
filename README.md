accessibility-bootcamp
======================

My working notes and ideas for an accessibility bootcamp to be enjoyed (hopefully)
by a new intake of graduate developers at Marks and Spencer, Digital.

Things to remember:

* knowledge of HTML and other front-end technology unknown
* slides may not be totally relevant
* we want people excited about accessibility after the session has been run, not
nessessarily knowing all the answers

Things would like help with:
* accessibility resources
* additional content
* thoughts on existing content
